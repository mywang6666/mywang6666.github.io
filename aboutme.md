# Hello, I'm Mingyuan Wang!

I’m a curious engineer turned PhD student, currently based in Beijing, China. After several years in the industry designing hardware systems, I returned to academia to dive deeper into the frontier technology.

On this site, I share my research journey, technical reflections, side projects, and occasional musings on lifelong learning. If any of this resonates with you—whether you're a fellow researcher, an engineer, or just someone passionate about technology—I’d love to connect!
